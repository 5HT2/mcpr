Question: What is Rust used for?

Answer:
The README doesn't explicitly state what Rust is used for, but it provides some hints:

1. It mentions Rust is suitable for "critical services, embedded devices, and easily integrated with other languages", suggesting it can be used for systems programming, embedded development, and as a language that can interface with other languages.

2. It highlights Rust's performance ("Fast and memory-efficient") and reliability ("memory and thread safety"), implying it can be used for performance-critical applications that require robust memory safety guarantees.

However, the README doesn't give an exhaustive list of Rust's use cases. It focuses more on the language's key strengths rather than specific application areas.
