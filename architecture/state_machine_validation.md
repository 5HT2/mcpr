# State Machine Validation System for MCPR Framework

## Overview

The State Machine Validation System is designed to ensure correct development and deployment workflows when using the MCPR framework. It validates dependencies between components, enforces correct macro usage patterns, and enables automatic updates when components change.

## Validation States

The state machine operates on the following primary states:

1. **Development State**: Validates component dependencies during development
2. **Build State**: Validates component compatibility during compilation
3. **Deployment State**: Validates deployment requirements
4. **Runtime State**: Monitors and manages component interactions at runtime

## State Transitions

```
Development → Build → Deployment → Runtime
     ↑                                 |
     └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each state has specific validation rules and can trigger warnings, errors, or automatic actions based on the validation results.

## Validation Rules

### Development State Validation

- **Server Development**:
  - Validate tool, resource, and prompt definitions
  - Ensure authentication handlers exist for protected components
  - Verify transport configurations

- **Client Development**:
  - Ensure referenced servers exist or are mocked
  - Validate client capabilities against server requirements
  - Verify transport compatibility

- **Host Development**:
  - Ensure all referenced clients and servers exist
  - Validate compatibility between clients and servers
  - Verify resource and authentication configurations

### Build State Validation

- **Macro Expansion Validation**:
  - Verify correct macro usage patterns
  - Ensure required attributes are provided
  - Check for conflicting configurations

- **Dependency Validation**:
  - Ensure all referenced components are available
  - Verify version compatibility between components
  - Check for circular dependencies

### Deployment State Validation

- **Environment Validation**:
  - Verify required environment variables
  - Check for configuration completeness
  - Validate deployment target compatibility

- **Security Validation**:
  - Ensure authentication is configured for production
  - Verify TLS/SSL settings for secure transports
  - Check for exposed sensitive configurations

### Runtime State Validation

- **Connection Monitoring**:
  - Track client-server connections
  - Monitor transport health
  - Detect and recover from failures

- **Component Synchronization**:
  - Auto-refresh client tools when server tools change
  - Update resource caches when resources change
  - Synchronize authentication states

## Implementation Approach

The state machine validation system will be implemented through:

1. **Compile-Time Validation**:
   - Procedural macros that analyze and validate code during compilation
   - Build-time checks integrated with Cargo

2. **Runtime Validation**:
   - Dynamic validation during component initialization
   - Continuous monitoring during operation

3. **Development Tools**:
   - IDE integrations for real-time validation
   - CLI tools for validation and diagnostics

## Automatic Actions

Based on validation results, the system can perform automatic actions:

- **Auto-generation** of missing required components
- **Auto-refresh** of client tools when server tools change
- **Auto-configuration** based on detected environment
- **Auto-recovery** from certain runtime failures

## Configuration

The validation system can be configured through:

```yaml
# validation.yaml
validation:
  development:
    strict: true
    auto_fix: true
    
  build:
    fail_on_warning: false
    
  deployment:
    environments:
      - development
      - staging
      - production
    
  runtime:
    auto_refresh: true
    cache_resources: true
    cache_ttl: 3600
```
